### Data Sourcing
Digitately Drive (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nxESpFzWjlGDMGDVLH69xmDzIl9l6OEq/edit#gid=633280281)
Thera are 3 tables but one was used for the analysis

### Data Modelling

Automatically derived relationships which can be adjusted to remove and replace unwanted relationships with the required.

Model View
:---------------:

Slicers - 
These are the main controllers of the visual. The narrow vast information to aid in getting more accurate answers for the problem statements

Tables - 
These visuals display large amount of data for which can be easily filtered for accurate results 

Cards - 
Display accurate numbers for the results against chosen slicers

Bar Charts - 
Provide changing but accurate results based off of values chosen in the slicers
